    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to your first [Jupyter notebook](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#jupyter-notebook). [Jupyter notebooks](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#jupyter-notebook) are documents that contain both computer code (like [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python)) alongside explanatory images, figures, videos, and links. Most importantly, the code in a [Jupyter notebook](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#jupyter-notebook) can be executed, modified, and deleted. As you explore this notebook, please feel free to modify the text, the code, and to generally play around with the environment. You can always [launch another instance of this notebook](https://constellate.org/docs/intro-to-jupyter-notebooks/) that will restore its original configuration. Later, you may learn how to create, modify, and save your own notebooks to share with others."
